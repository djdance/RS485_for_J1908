how to recompile NDK libs (serial and gpio)

0.remove libs+obj!!!
1.go to project root in terminal
2. run C:\Users\djdance\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\ndk-bundle\ndk-build
2.1 or C:\Users\djdance\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\android-ndk-r14b\ndk-build
(according to the path to ndk, previously downloaded via SDK manager of AS)

it will completely clear both libs/armeabi !!! if you want to compile one lib separately, backup others! (all, to be sure)
